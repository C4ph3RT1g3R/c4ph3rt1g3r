### ⚡ Fun facts:
- I am great a cryptography, but due to dyscalculia I have trouble with maths. As a result, I compensate with recognizing pattern, which made me a very talented, accidental, unofficial OSINT investigator.
- I love taking things apart, finding out how they work, changing how they work, and repairing or improving them in ways for which they were not originally designed. As a result, I generally can look at something and know how to assemble or disassemble it with ease. I will still use instructions or guides, but it is rare that I need them.
